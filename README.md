# Word-Cloud
My First Simple Project using Python:
This project generates a word cloud from a given text file that contains a text from a website or a book or a novel (or anywhere really) by removing all punctuation marks and unnecessary words like (i, and, the, for) and many more. The path to the text file should be edited of course to where the text file exists on your machine locally. 
Important Notes:
The text should be ready in a text file stored locally on your computer, and include the path to the text file in the main.py file, an image will be generated in the folder that contains the project.
