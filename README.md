# Word-Cloud
My First Simple Project using Python, using any text from a website or a book to generate a word cloud of the most common words
Important Notes:
The text should be ready in a text file stored locally on your computer, and include the path to the text file in the main.py file, an image will be generated in the folder that contains the project.
